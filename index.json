These casing stones are still here 4500 years later, and the majority of courses are straight, even and well fitted.\nWith that said: there are also significant consistency issues with what we can see of the North Face, and to some extent the South Face. The East Face, in contrast, is much neater. The North Face has significant upwards bulging of the center of its stone courses, and multiple sections of \u0026quot;wobbly\u0026quot; masonry above this area, which is likely due to the difficulty of juggling between a desire for straight, even courses and needing to correct for the earlier bulging issues. The South Face is straight on average, but also contains several \u0026quot;wobbly\u0026quot; masonry courses, mostly centered around individual stones which are taller or shorter than they should be.\nNorth Face South Face Coloured by vertical offset from course Coloured by vertical offset from course Coloured by relative height to course Coloured by relative height to course Tall and short stones, and the not-quite-straight masonry surround them Tall and short stones, and the not-quite-straight masonry surround them The height of the casing stones is maintained within a course around the faces of the pyramid (i.e. from north to east to south), and the statistical distribution of the stones within each of these unified courses appears to be consistent. This suggests a singular source and quarrying directive supplying each unified course. Note how the highlighted courses all have lower average width, across all three faces. They are surrounded by courses above and below with higher average width. Bulging in the North Face There is very visable upwards deflection (bulging) of the courses on the North Face. By examining the expected vertical position of courses based on the height of casing stones, it is clear that the corners of the courses are at the correct position, and the centre is located higher up than it should be. This construction issue occured below the current level of the casing stones, and is not present on the other faces (I also visually inspected photos of the West Face and couldn't see any). Stones coloured by their course. Some white and red horizontal lines for comparison of 'straightness'.\nBlue=North, Green=East, Red=South. Lighter lines are measure of absolute deflection of a single course (vertical offset between center and edges of a course), darker lines of cumulative deflection (how much taller/shorter the center stones of a course are compared to the edge stones).\nThe above graph charts the deflection of the courses numerically. Note that: below course 75 on the North Face, the courses are missing the outside casing stones. This obscurs the singular course deflection measurement (lighter lines) which is measured as the different in vertical position between the edges and the center of the course. The cumulative deflection measurement is also affected, however the actual numbers can be estimated and the difference is minimal.\nThe cumulative deflection series for East and South also show a small amount of deflection (darker), however comparison with the absolute deflection (lighter) suggests that this is the result of some small systematic error which has accumulated.\nBlue=North, Yellow=East, Red=South. Local deflection causes by each individual course. NOTE WHEN DOING THIS CHART, SWAWP THE EAST SOUTH COLOURS TO MATCH EARLIER CHART\nBy observing the contribution to the total deflection from each course, we can see that for the entirety of the height of casing stones still remaining, the North Face builders were trying to correct for the positive vertical deflection which must have originated further down the pyramid.\nJoining, or fitting, stones https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43V9RTpnxbk\nIntroduction text: \u0026quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

A vertical slice down the center of the pyramid. External, sloping pyramid dimensions. The entirety of a single face. The (original) height of the pyramid was 143.5m. The angle between the face and the horizontal is approximately 53.15degrees, with different sources providing slightly different exact numbers. If you calculate the length along the centreline of a face of the pyramid, up to the apex, you get 179.45m (from the base length and the vertical height). The ratio of these two lengths is 1:1.25, or 0.8:1. This seems like a good, simple ratio (4 to 5) for the pyramid builders to use, so I used this ratio (approx. 53.13degrees) when scaling the image data I had.\nI used the three tall consecutive courses (courses 71-73) of casing stones as an achor for scaling the image. From visual inspection, the casing stones make up the top 28-30% of the pyramid height, and the three tall courses occur approximately 75% down the casing stones. This puts the three tall courses approx. 39m below the apex, as measured along the angled face, and approx. 31.2m vertically below the apex. The width of the casing stone courses at this point is approx. 46.9m. Note that, the effective angle of the edge of the face itself, when measured in the plane of the face, is 59 degrees.\nPictures Introduction text: \u0026quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Construction Consistency INSERT SIDE BY SIDE IMAGES OF relative width?\nConstruction appears much more consistent near the apex of the pyramid, and below course 55. The construction near to the corners of the pyramid is much more uniform throughout, due to the builders utilising a consistent, repeating pattern in the stonework. Since the top of the pyramid has a higher proportion of its width taken up by these \u0026quot;edge patterns\u0026quot;, it appears more uniform.\nIn the below chart, the courses have stones with a more uniform average width below course 55. Courses 30 - 55 appear to have many taller and wider courses.\nINSERT CHART OF Avg Stone Width Within Course by Course,\n2. Bulging in the North Face INSERT HEIGHT REALTIVE TO COURSE NORTH FACE\nAt some point in construction, the center of the north-face courses began to bulge upwards, become higher than the edges of the course. There appears to have been a concerted effort to fix this issue, by using shorter blocks for the centers of the course. This effort began below the currently existing courses (below 89), and corrected by roughly 2.7cm per course between courses 75 and 50, and by roughly 1.09cm per course between courses 50 and 10. Above course 10 the issue is resolved.\nCHART OF DEFLECTION AND CUMULTIVE DEFLECTION BY COURSE\n3. Similarity in stone widths across faces There is a weak correlation between the average widths of casing stones which are on the same course, but different faces of the pyramid. Mostly, it is noticeable that courses within a face with narrow or wide stones, tend to maintain this pattern around the other faces. Note courses 23, 47 and 52 all have much narrower stones than their adjacent courses.\nCHART OF AVG WIDTH BY COURSE\n4. The three large courses INSERT ALL THREE PICTURES OF HEIGHT RELATIVE TO AVG HEIGHT, SIDE BY SIDE\nThere are three visually distinctive courses, which all have very tall stones compared to the average. These correspond to 71-73, and are an interesting feature of the casing stones. Perhaps the builders encountered a very large seam of high quality limestone during their quarrying, and wished to take advantage of it.\n5. Joining or fitting stones INSERT ALL THREE PICTURES OF width RELATIVE TO AVG width within course, SIDE BY SIDE\nThere appears to be linear patterns of small stones (as others have noted, REF), which segment the pyramid faces into sections. This may well be evidence of sections of the face being the duty of seperate work crews, and these smaller stones were use to bridge or join the gap between the more normal stones laid by the two seperate work crews.\nINSERT 2, side by side, images of north face width relCourse, and an annotated image drawing lines of stones\nMany of these \u0026quot;fitting\u0026quot; stones have angled vertical edges, which would allow them to be maneuvered into place from above. The construction of this angled edge, would likely involve taken one of the \u0026quot;normal\u0026quot; blocks, and cutting it at an angle into two trapezoids. The smaller trapezoid can then be shaved down to the exact size needed to fit the gap, and dropped into place from above.\nINSERT several, side by side, images of individual \u0026quot;fitting\u0026quot; stones\n6. Chains of offset stones INSERT SIDE BY SIDE EXAMPLES OF CHAINS OF STONES\nThere appear to be \u0026quot;chains\u0026quot; of stones, whereby each stone in the chain is offset from the previous by a set amount, and the size of the stones in the chain are all very similar. The number of these occuring mean these aren't random chance, and are somehow related to the building technique.\nSome of these chains are offset at an angle similar to the angle of the edge of the face, but some are in the opposite direction.\nIt is possible, that multiple courses were placed simultaneously, and these chains of stones were the first ones placed amidst otherwise empty courses. Chains of stones in a consistent, overlapping pattern, and with the correct course height, could be useful as an anchor of stability within the otherwise more peicemeal construction.\n7. Alternating corner pattern INSERT TWO zoomed in images of the pattern, one with 1+1 to overlap, 1 with 1+2 to overlap\nThe edges of each course follow a distinctive alternating pattern. A wide corner stone is then followed above by a narrower corner stone, and a second (and sometimes third) stone which extends to overlap the first stone.\nThere are also hints of an alternating taller to shorter to taller pattern in the corner stones.\nINSERT IMAGE Height rel to course (EAST?) zoomed in on corner area exibiting this\n8. Change in the corner pattern INSERT IMAGE OF THE TRANSITION\nAround course 33, there is a shift in the width of the corner stones. Both wide and narrow corner stones are wider on average below course 33, and the wide corner stones in particular are significantly wider.\nINSERT MINI TABLE WITH SOME STATS FROM WIDE LOWER CORNER VS WIDER UPPER CORNER\n9. Angles of stone’s vertical edges Overall, left edges are slightly clockwise rotated, and right edges are slightly anti-clockwise rotated, which makes sense due to the strongly angled edges of the cornerstones. Without the cornerstones in the analysis, edge angles average out to vertical. When considering stones on the left half of the face, vs those on the right, it can be seen that edge angles are slightly more likely to be angled in the same direction as the nearest edge of the face.\nINSERT MINI TABLE WITH STATS\n10. Angles on corner stones Both left and right corners, have an average other edge angle of 1.75degrees. This average \u0026quot;other edge angle\u0026quot; leans towards the same side as the pyramid edge. This is in comparison to an average angle of 1.5degrees on non-corner stones.\nINSERT MINI TABLE\n11. Vertical edge angle distribution by size of stone Both large and small stones, have a similar distribution of edge angles, with both groups averaging out to a near zero edge angle (when excluding corner stones).\nINSERT MINI TABLE\n12. Distribution of course heights Course height tends to decrease up the pyramid, and there seems to be a clear minimum course height, which also decreases up the pyramid.\nINSERT CHART OF COURSE HEIGHT VS COURSE, WITH DRAWN ON EXTRA LINES FOR MIN AND TRENDLINE\n13. Distribution of stone width by course Stone width appears un-correlated with course number, however below course 55, the width is much more consistant from course to course. Between course 50 - 55, there are many courses with higher average width. There also appears to be some clustering of higher widths (i.e. high width adjacent course predicts higher avg stone width in this course).\nINSERT CHART OF COURSE AVG STONE WIDTH BY COURSE\n14. Relationship between width of stone and height of course Slight negative correlation between height of course and avg. width of stone within that course. If courses 40-50 are removed there is probably no correlation, as courses 40-50 have many short courses with wide stones.\nINSERT CHART OF \u0026quot;Stone Width vs Height within Course\u0026quot;\n15. Height variation of stones within a course INSERT 3 IMAGES SIDE BY SIDE OF RELATIVE HEIGHT TO COURSE\nNot much of any obious pattern. The random variation of stone heights from what they should be is larger than the average \u0026quot;correction\u0026quot; done on the north face. It is clear on the north face that there are more taller than average stones near the edges of the course. And possibly also more shorter stones within the central part of the course.\n16. Course width by height up the pyramid INSERT CHART OF COURSE WIDTH VS DIST FROM APEX\nA very consistent linear correlation. Only slightly noisy near the top and near the bottom, due to missing stones\n17. Distribution of breaks in courses INSERT CHART OF BREAKS\nMore gaps lower down the pyramid, which is to be expected sense since there are more stones to be missing.

Vertical deflection of courses INSERT CHART CUMULATIVE DEFLECTION\nSlightly noisy distribution centered around 0 for the east and south faces. The north face has more shorter stones in the centre (than taller ones), resulting in a significant, non-zero cumulative deflection. This appears to be an intentional effort to correct the \u0026quot;bulging\u0026quot; issue. The dropoff in \u0026quot;Deflection vs edges\u0026quot; after course 75 is due to the edges of those courses being missing.\nINSERT CHART OF local deflection of center vs edge\n20. Stone stats by position along course Most statistics do not deviate from the overall distribution. Edge angle has an interesting pattern, notably more edges are aligned towards the pyramid edge closest to them.\nINSERT CHART OF EDGE ANGLE BY FRACTION ALONG COURSE\n21.

Wide vs narrow corner stones Overall, wide corners are slightly further down on average and wide corners are very slightly taller on average.\n27. Contribution of “bad” stones Since only 5 stones were identified as \u0026quot;bad\u0026quot; with the method I used, excluding them from the statistics had little effect.\n28. Width vs height Slight negative correlation between width and height of casing stones. i.e. if a stone is wider, it is likely to also be slightly shorter. This may be because larger stones are harder to transport. It is particularly noticeable that almost all of the larger stones are only up to around average height, and not taller.\nINSERT CHART WITH TRENDLINE HERE\n29. Stats by height Very wide stones tend to be significantly shorter.\n30. Stats by width By considering width vs fraction along course, can see that wide stones are often the first or last stones in a course.\n31.

Gaps at top of South Face The gaps between stones at the top of the South Face, are due to stones shifting to the left of where they should be. This was possibly caused by an earthquake, or by whoever tumbled the missing top stones down the pyramid. Top of the South Face. White lines indicate the expected pyramid outline. Note how the top courses are shifted left outside the outline, and moreso near the top.\nAcknowledgements Desmos for triangle diagrams, \u0026quot;History for Granite\u0026quot; youtube channel, etc. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43V9RTpnxbk\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/amthomson/albums/72157667783909188/with/26579978777/ Aidan McRae Thomson\nIntroduction text: \u0026quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
