These casing stones are still here 4500 years later, and the majority of courses are straight, even and well fitted.\nWith that said: there are also significant consistency issues with what we can see of the North Face, and to some extent the South Face. The East Face, in contrast, is much neater. The North Face has significant upwards bulging of the center of its stone courses, and multiple sections of \u0026quot;wobbly\u0026quot; masonry above this area, which is likely due to the difficulty of juggling between a desire for straight, even courses and needing to correct for the earlier bulging issues. The South Face is straight on average, but also contains several \u0026quot;wobbly\u0026quot; masonry courses, mostly centered around individual stones which are taller or shorter than they should be.\nNorth Face South Face Coloured by vertical offset from course Coloured by vertical offset from course Coloured by relative height to course Coloured by relative height to course Tall and short stones, and the not-quite-straight masonry surround them Tall and short stones, and the not-quite-straight masonry surround them The height of the casing stones is maintained within a course around the faces of the pyramid (i.e. from north to east to south), and the statistical distribution of the stones within each of these unified courses appears to be consistent. This suggests a singular source and quarrying directive supplying each unified course. Note how the highlighted courses all have lower average width, across all three faces. They are surrounded by courses above and below with higher average width. The images of the masonry orientation (below) give a good comparison of the \u0026quot;straightness\u0026quot; of the different faces. The North Face is obviously the outlier, but note that both the East and South faces have some issues at the very top, with gaps appearing between casing stones and angled masonry occuring. The right side of the East Face joins with the left side of the North Face, and the clockwise and anticlockwise angles illustrated below pair up between them. This shows the top North-East corner is slightly sunken, probably a result of the larger issues further down the North Face.\nThe right of the South Face joins with the left of the East Face. The angles between these two do not align, as the East is level while the South is angled clockwise. This suggests that at these upper levels, the southern courses are slightly higher than the corresponding eastern courses. Note also, that the top left stones of the South Face, have slid to the left of their original positions.\nNorth Face East Face South Face Coloured by the angle of the local masonry surrounding the stone, red = clockwise (full red at \u0026gt;=7degrees), blue = anticlockwise (full blue at \u0026gt;=7degrees)\nBulging in the North Face There is very visable upwards deflection (bulging) of the courses on the North Face. By examining the expected vertical position of courses based on the height of casing stones, it is clear that the corners of the courses are at the correct position, and the centre is located higher up than it should be. This construction issue occured below the current level of the casing stones, and is not present on the other faces (I also visually inspected photos of the West Face and couldn't see any). Stones coloured by their course. Some white and red horizontal lines for comparison of 'straightness'.\nOrientation of each stone Local orientation around each stone red = clockwise (full red at \u0026gt;=7degrees) blue = anticlockwise (full blue at \u0026gt;=7degrees) Blue=North, Green=East, Red=South. Lighter lines are measure of absolute deflection of a single course (vertical offset between center and edges of a course), darker lines of cumulative deflection (how much taller/shorter the center stones of a course are compared to the edge stones).\nThe above graph charts the deflection of the courses numerically. Note that: below course 75 on the North Face, the courses are missing the outside casing stones. This obscurs the singular course deflection measurement (lighter lines) which is measured as the different in vertical position between the edges and the center of the course. The cumulative deflection measurement is also affected, however the actual numbers can be estimated and the difference is minimal.\nThe cumulative deflection series for East and South also show a small amount of deflection (darker), however comparison with the absolute deflection (lighter) suggests that this is the result of some small systematic error which has accumulated.\nBlue=North, Yellow=East, Red=South. Local deflection causes by each individual course. NOTE WHEN DOING THIS CHART, SWAWP THE EAST SOUTH COLOURS TO MATCH EARLIER CHART\nBy observing the contribution to the total deflection from each course, we can see that for the entirety of the height of casing stones still remaining, the North Face builders were trying to correct for the positive vertical deflection which must have originated further down the pyramid.\nJoining, or fitting, stones As has been noted by the youtube channel \u0026quot;History for Granite\u0026quot; in his video on the casing stones, there appear to be smaller stones whose purpose is to join sections of masonry which were built concurrently.\nThese smaller fitting stones appear to be used to join regions of a course built by seperate workcrews, as the distribution of these small stones is consistent with the vertical splitting the face into sections of more even size.\nBy attempting to plot lines which seperate the face into sections (below right), you can see a somewhat symmetrical pattern, suggesting there was some attempt by the builders to spread the workcrews evening across the avaliable space (along each course). The fact that these joining stones do not align in a neat pattern to the courses immediately adjacent above and below, suggests that the horizontal courses were constructed in full before moving on to the next, instead of constructing multiple courses simultaneously. In contrast to this, the chains of offset stones section suggests the opposite.\nSmaller Stones (North) Possible regions (North) Coloured by relative width to course, red = wider, blue = narrower Green lines highlight possible regions which were constructed in parallel Stone Width (East) Stone Width (South) Coloured by relative width to course, red = wider, blue = narrower Coloured by relative width to course, red = wider, blue = narrower Alternating corner pattern The edges of each course follow a distinctive alternating pattern. A wide corner stone is then followed above by a narrower corner stone, and a second (and sometimes third) stone which extends to overlap the first stone.\nZoom in on North Face (left) and South Face (right). The North Face courses are from high up on the casing stones, and the South Face courses are from lower down on the face. Red: Wide corner stone. Teal: Narrow corner stone. Green: 1st Overlapping stone. Blue: 2nd Overlapping stone for top only. Purple: 2nd Overlapping stone for above and below.\nAround course 33 and below, there is a shift in the width of the corner stones. Both wide and narrow corner stones are wider on average below course 33, and the wide corner stones in particular are significantly wider. Conversely, the \u0026quot;1st Overlapping stone\u0026quot; (in green above) is narrower in some sections further down the pyramid.\nStone Width (North) Stone Width (East) Stone Width (South) Coloured by width, red = wider, blue = narrower\nNote how the wide corner stones are a darker red/orange lower down, and a lighter colour higher up, demonstrating this shift in their width.\nAngles on the vertical edges of stones Overall, left edges (of stones) are on average slightly clockwise rotated, and right edges are slightly anti-clockwise rotated, which makes sense due to the strongly angled edges of the cornerstones. Without the cornerstones in the analysis, edge angles average out to vertical.\nWhen considering stones on the left half of the face, vs those on the right, it can be seen that both vertical edges are slightly more likely to be angled in the same direction as the nearest edge of the face (by around 1.2degrees). This tendancy for edges to be angled in the same direction as the pyramid edge, is also exhibited on corner stones' non-corner edge.\nLeft Edge Angles Right Edge Angles North North East East South South The above images show the clustering of clockwise angles (red) on the left half of the faces, and anticlockwise (blue) on the right half. This phenomenom is not random chance, but seems too small to be a concious effort by the builders. This leaves either: an unintentional effect of the construction process, or \u0026quot;external\u0026quot; causes such as slumping or earthquakes. If the (internal) central part of the pyramid was more solid, then the outsides of the pyramid coule have settled to a slightly lower height as more weight was piled up on the pyramid. Even if the builders accounted for this issue by re-levelling each course as they went, it could leave these angular defects.\nChains of offset stones There are \u0026quot;chains\u0026quot; of stones, wherein each stone in the chain is offset from the previous by a set amount, and the size of the stones in the chain are either similar, or decrease slowly as you go up courses. The number of chains occuring suggest these aren't random chance, and are somehow related to the construction strategy of the casing stones.\nNorth, left half North, right half North, left half North, central North, right half East Most chains are offset in the same direction as their nearest pyramid edge, but not all of them. It is likely that these \u0026quot;chains\u0026quot; represent the first stones laid down on each course, within a section of the pyramid assigned to a particular workcrew.

A vertical slice down the center of the pyramid. External, sloping pyramid dimensions. The entirety of a single face. The (original) height of the pyramid was 143.5m. The angle between the face and the horizontal is approximately 53.15°, with different sources providing slightly different exact numbers. If you calculate the length along the centreline of a face of the pyramid, up to the apex, you get 179.45m (from the base length and the vertical height). The ratio of these two lengths is 1:1.25, or 0.8:1. This seems like a good, simple ratio (4 to 5) for the pyramid builders to use, so I used this ratio (approx. 53.13°) when scaling the image data I had.\nI used the three tall consecutive courses (courses 71-73) of casing stones as an achor for scaling the image. From visual inspection, the casing stones make up the top 28-30% of the pyramid height, and the three tall courses occur approximately 75% down the casing stones. This puts the three tall courses approx. 39m below the apex, as measured along the angled face, and approx. 31.2m vertically below the apex. The width of the casing stone courses at this point is approx. 46.9m. Note that, the effective angle of the edge of the face itself, when measured in the plane of the face, is 59°.\nPictures Oculi omnium in te sperant, Domine, et tu das illis cibum in tempore, aperis manum tuam, et imples omne animal benedictione.

Construction Consistency INSERT SIDE BY SIDE IMAGES OF relative width?\nConstruction appears much more consistent near the apex of the pyramid, and below course 55. The construction near to the corners of the pyramid is much more uniform throughout, due to the builders utilising a consistent, repeating pattern in the stonework. Since the top of the pyramid has a higher proportion of its width taken up by these \u0026quot;edge patterns\u0026quot;, it appears more uniform.\nIn the below chart, the courses have stones with a more uniform average width below course 55. Courses 30 - 55 appear to have many taller and wider courses.\nINSERT CHART OF Avg Stone Width Within Course by Course,\n2. Bulging in the North Face INSERT HEIGHT REALTIVE TO COURSE NORTH FACE\nAt some point in construction, the center of the north-face courses began to bulge upwards, become higher than the edges of the course. There appears to have been a concerted effort to fix this issue, by using shorter blocks for the centers of the course. This effort began below the currently existing courses (below 89), and corrected by roughly 2.7cm per course between courses 75 and 50, and by roughly 1.09cm per course between courses 50 and 10. Above course 10 the issue is resolved.\nCHART OF DEFLECTION AND CUMULTIVE DEFLECTION BY COURSE\n3. Similarity in stone widths across faces There is a weak correlation between the average widths of casing stones which are on the same course, but different faces of the pyramid. Mostly, it is noticeable that courses within a face with narrow or wide stones, tend to maintain this pattern around the other faces. Note courses 23, 47 and 52 all have much narrower stones than their adjacent courses.\nCHART OF AVG WIDTH BY COURSE\n4. The three large courses INSERT ALL THREE PICTURES OF HEIGHT RELATIVE TO AVG HEIGHT, SIDE BY SIDE\nThere are three visually distinctive courses, which all have very tall stones compared to the average. These correspond to 71-73, and are an interesting feature of the casing stones. Perhaps the builders encountered a very large seam of high quality limestone during their quarrying, and wished to take advantage of it.\n5. Joining or fitting stones INSERT ALL THREE PICTURES OF width RELATIVE TO AVG width within course, SIDE BY SIDE\nThere appears to be linear patterns of small stones (as others have noted, REF), which segment the pyramid faces into sections. This may well be evidence of sections of the face being the duty of seperate work crews, and these smaller stones were use to bridge or join the gap between the more normal stones laid by the two seperate work crews.\nINSERT 2, side by side, images of north face width relCourse, and an annotated image drawing lines of stones\nMany of these \u0026quot;fitting\u0026quot; stones have angled vertical edges, which would allow them to be maneuvered into place from above. The construction of this angled edge, would likely involve taken one of the \u0026quot;normal\u0026quot; blocks, and cutting it at an angle into two trapezoids. The smaller trapezoid can then be shaved down to the exact size needed to fit the gap, and dropped into place from above.\nINSERT several, side by side, images of individual \u0026quot;fitting\u0026quot; stones\n6. Chains of offset stones INSERT SIDE BY SIDE EXAMPLES OF CHAINS OF STONES\nThere appear to be \u0026quot;chains\u0026quot; of stones, whereby each stone in the chain is offset from the previous by a set amount, and the size of the stones in the chain are all very similar. The number of these occuring mean these aren't random chance, and are somehow related to the building technique.\nSome of these chains are offset at an angle similar to the angle of the edge of the face, but some are in the opposite direction.\nIt is possible, that multiple courses were placed simultaneously, and these chains of stones were the first ones placed amidst otherwise empty courses. Chains of stones in a consistent, overlapping pattern, and with the correct course height, could be useful as an anchor of stability within the otherwise more peicemeal construction.\n7. Alternating corner pattern INSERT TWO zoomed in images of the pattern, one with 1+1 to overlap, 1 with 1+2 to overlap\nThe edges of each course follow a distinctive alternating pattern. A wide corner stone is then followed above by a narrower corner stone, and a second (and sometimes third) stone which extends to overlap the first stone.\nThere are also hints of an alternating taller to shorter to taller pattern in the corner stones.\nINSERT IMAGE Height rel to course (EAST?) zoomed in on corner area exibiting this\n8. Change in the corner pattern INSERT IMAGE OF THE TRANSITION\nAround course 33, there is a shift in the width of the corner stones. Both wide and narrow corner stones are wider on average below course 33, and the wide corner stones in particular are significantly wider.\nINSERT MINI TABLE WITH SOME STATS FROM WIDE LOWER CORNER VS WIDER UPPER CORNER\n9. Angles of stone’s vertical edges Overall, left edges are slightly clockwise rotated, and right edges are slightly anti-clockwise rotated, which makes sense due to the strongly angled edges of the cornerstones. Without the cornerstones in the analysis, edge angles average out to vertical. When considering stones on the left half of the face, vs those on the right, it can be seen that edge angles are slightly more likely to be angled in the same direction as the nearest edge of the face.\nINSERT MINI TABLE WITH STATS\nThe distribution of edge angles appears the same for each of the three faces analysed. This is somewhat unexpected, as on the North Face many of the stones are themselves at a slant due to the bulging issue. Since I used the angle from the vertical for my calculations, I would have expected a slightly higher average absolute edge angle for the North Face due to the contribution from these slanted stones. Since the average absolute angle of any vertical edge is only around 2degrees off the vertical, it is hard to immediately tell if the correction efforts occuring on the North Face counteracted the contribution from the non-straight courses, or if the contribution was just very minimal.\n10. Angles on corner stones Both left and right corners, have an average other edge angle of 1.25°. This average \u0026quot;other edge angle\u0026quot; leans towards the same side as the pyramid edge. This is very similar to the average for non-corner stones.\nINSERT MINI TABLE\n11. Vertical edge angle distribution by size of stone Both large and small stones, have a similar distribution of edge angles, with both groups averaging out to a near zero edge angle (when excluding corner stones).\nINSERT MINI TABLE\n12. Distribution of course heights Course height tends to decrease up the pyramid, and there seems to be a clear minimum course height, which also decreases up the pyramid.\nINSERT CHART OF COURSE HEIGHT VS COURSE, WITH DRAWN ON EXTRA LINES FOR MIN AND TRENDLINE\n13. Distribution of stone width by course Stone width appears un-correlated with course number, however below course 55, the width is much more consistant from course to course. Between course 50 - 55, there are many courses with higher average width. There also appears to be some clustering of higher widths (i.e. high width adjacent course predicts higher avg stone width in this course).\nINSERT CHART OF COURSE AVG STONE WIDTH BY COURSE\n14. Relationship between width of stone and height of course Slight negative correlation between height of course and avg. width of stone within that course. If courses 40-50 are removed there is probably no correlation, as courses 40-50 have many short courses with wide stones.\nINSERT CHART OF \u0026quot;Stone Width vs Height within Course\u0026quot;\n15. Height variation of stones within a course INSERT 3 IMAGES SIDE BY SIDE OF RELATIVE HEIGHT TO COURSE\nNot much of any obious pattern. The random variation of stone heights from what they should be is larger than the average \u0026quot;correction\u0026quot; done on the north face.

Edge angle has an interesting pattern, notably more edges are aligned towards the pyramid edge closest to them.\nINSERT CHART OF EDGE ANGLE BY FRACTION ALONG COURSE\n21. Big vs small stones Statistic Comparison Fraction fill Similar Distance down pyramid Bigger is further down Distribution along course Similar Edge angles Similar Width Bigger stones are significantly narrower (approx 80cm vs 110cm) 22. Wide vs narrow stones Statistic Comparison Fraction fill Similar Distance down pyramid Similar Distribution along course Similar Edge angles Similar, but narrower stones have a slightly higher absolute edge angle (2.1° vs 1.9°) Height Narrower stones are very slightly taller 23. Upper vs lower stones Statistic Comparison Fraction fill Similar Distance down pyramid Bigger is further down Distribution along course Similar Edge angles Lower stones have slightly more angled edges (abs. edge angle of 2.25° vs 1.7°) Height Lower stones are taller Width Lower stones are slightly narrower Size Lower stones are significantly bigger 24. Right vs left half stones left stones are very slightly larger, due to them being slightly wider on average. Right stones have left+right edge angles approx 1.2° anti-clockwise, left stones have left+right edge angles approx 1.2° clockwise\nStatistic Comparison Fraction fill Similar Edge angles ~1.2° clockwise for left stones and anti-clockwise for right stones Height Similar Width Left stones are slightly wider 25. Corner stones Corner stones are on average: significantly shorter and wider. Note that we are missing some of the corners near the bottom, where the courses are taller.\nINSERT STATS MINI TABLE\n26. Wide vs narrow corner stones Overall, wide corners are slightly further down on average and wide corners are very slightly taller on average.\n27. Contribution of “bad” stones Since only 5 stones were identified as \u0026quot;bad\u0026quot; with the method I used, excluding them from the statistics had little effect.\n28. Width vs height Slight negative correlation between width and height of casing stones. i.e. if a stone is wider, it is likely to also be slightly shorter. This may be because larger stones are harder to transport. It is particularly noticeable that almost all of the larger stones are only up to around average height, and not taller.\nINSERT CHART WITH TRENDLINE HERE\n29. Stats by height Very wide stones tend to be significantly shorter.\n30. Stats by width By considering width vs fraction along course, can see that wide stones are often the first or last stones in a course.\n31. Stats by size INSERT IMAGE OF SIZE REL ALL , 3 SIDE BY SIDE\nThe biggest stones seem less likely to occur near the center of the course.\nINSERT CHART\n32. Alignment of central stones The \u0026quot;central stones\u0026quot; are stones which span the vertical centreline of the pyramid.\nStatistic Comparison Fraction fill Similar Edge angles Much more vertical edge angles than average, (approx. 1° average angle vs 2°) Width Slightly wider than average Size Slightly smaller than average Offset from centreline Approximately 5cm right on average 33. Gaps at top of South Face The gaps between stones at the top of the South Face, are due to stones shifting to the left of where they should be. This was possibly caused by an earthquake, or by whoever tumbled the missing top stones down the pyramid. Top of the South Face. White lines indicate the expected pyramid outline. Note how the top courses are shifted left outside the outline, and moreso near the top.\nThere are also some gaps, albeit smaller, at the top of the East Face (see below), however the edge casing stones still appear to be in the correct places. Inspection of photos of the East Face indicate that these gaps may be caused by stones being shifted outwards from the face, and rotated slightly.\nTop of the East Face. White lines indicate the expected pyramid outline.\nAcknowledgements Desmos for triangle diagrams, \u0026quot;History for Granite\u0026quot; youtube channel, etc. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43V9RTpnxbk\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/amthomson/albums/72157667783909188/with/26579978777/ Aidan McRae Thomson\nOculi omnium in te sperant, Domine, et tu das illis cibum in tempore, aperis manum tuam, et imples omne animal benedictione.
