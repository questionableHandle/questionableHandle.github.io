            Introduction The Pharaohs of the Old Kingdom&#39;s 4th Dynasty built towering, artificial sacred mountains of stone on the plateau overlooking their capital, Memphis. A pyramid was a symbol of their power and their dominance over both the physical world in which they resided and the intangible horizon that segregated the earth from the heavens.
Khafre oversaw the building of the second-largest pyramid on bedrock ten metres higher than Khufu&#39;s, allowing his construction to rise above his predecessors&#39;.
