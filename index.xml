            Introduction Oculi omnium in te sperant, Domine, et tu das illis cibum in tempore, aperis manum tuam, et imples omne animal benedictione. Benedic, Domine, nos et dona tua, quae de tua largitate sumus sumpturi, et concede ut illis salubriter nutriti, tibi debitum obsequium praestare valeamus, per Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum.
Contents Main Observations Overview and Comparison of faces Data and Methodology All Observations Acknowledgements Main Observations Construction Consistency The construction of the casing stones still remaining is, in many ways, much more consistent than we might expect from only the second ever attempt at building such a large structure.
